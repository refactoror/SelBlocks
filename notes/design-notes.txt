try/catch/finally

At first glance, try/catch/finally seems to be a mechanism for handling errors. But errors are only one of several "bubbling" actions that '''try''' is intended to handle. Probably the best way to understand this is to consider what '''finally''' provides. It guarantees that the code inside the finally block will be executed after the code inside the try block, even if a bubbling event occurs in the try block. An error is one example of that, but there is also '''continue''', '''break''', and '''return''', each of which involves a kind of bubbling. For example, if you return from a function from inside of a try block, then the return will be delayed until the finally block can be executed.

Both finally and catch are optional, but at least one of them must be present for try to mean anything.

As of SelBlocks 2, for loop variable(s) no longer need to be separately declared, (ie, listed in the Value field)
