=SelBlocks 2.0=

Installer: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide-sel-blocks/versions/

=Description=

Provides Selenium commands for javascript-like conditionals, looping, callable functions, error catching, and JSON/XML driven parameterization.

=Features=

* Adds the following control structures to Selenese: <tt>if</tt>/<tt>elseIf</tt>/<tt>else</tt>, <tt>try</tt>/<tt>catch</tt>/<tt>finally</tt>/<tt>throw</tt>, <tt>for</tt>/<tt>foreach</tt>/<tt>while</tt>, <tt>continue</tt>/<tt>break</tt>, <tt>call</tt>/<tt>function</tt>/<tt>return</tt>, <tt>loadXmlVars</tt>/<tt>loadJsonVars</tt>, <tt>forXml</tt>/<tt>forJson</tt>, <tt>exitTest</tt>
* Function and loop parameters use regular Selenium variables that are local to the block, overriding variables of the same name, and that are restored when the block exits.
* Command parameters are javascript expressions that are evaluated with Selenium variables in scope, which can therefore be referenced by their simple names, e.g.: <tt>i+1</tt>
* Variables can be configured via external XML and/or JSON files.
* A function definition can appear anywhere, (they are skipped over in normal execution flow).
* Functions can be called recursively.

=Examples of Use=

Note that Selenium performs variable substitution before each command executes. When Selenium variables are used in SelBlock parameters, which are JavaScript expressions, they are evaluated as literals. So for example, you would write: <tt>$(userid}</tt>. Or more simply: <tt>userid</tt>.

 foreach|userid|"dilbert","dogbert"
   getEval|LOG.info("${userid}");
   if|userid=="dilbert"
     getEval|LOG.info("${userid}, our hero");
   elseIf|userid=="ratbert"
     getEval|LOG.info("${userid}, the villain");
   else
     getEval|LOG.info("${userid}");
   endIf
 endForeach

 for|i=1; i <= 10; i++
   getEval|LOG.info("${i}");
 endFor

 loadVars|varset.xml
 loadVars|varset.xml|userid=="wally"
 getEval|LOG.info("${role}");

 forXml|varset.xml
   getEval|LOG.info("${userid}: ${role}");
 endForXml

 -- log odd numbers from 0 to 10
 for|i=0; i <= 100; i++
   break|i==10
   continue|i%2==0
   getEval|LOG.info("${i}");
 endFor

 -- extravagant example, but demonstrates possibilities
 call|factorial|n=7
 function|factorial
   if|n<=1
     return|1
   else
     call|factorial|n=n-1
     return|n*_result
   endIf
 endFunction
 getEval|LOG.info("${_result}");

 skipNext|1
 getEval|LOG.info("this will NOT execute");
 skipNext|0
 getEval|LOG.info("this WILL execute");
 goto|HERE
 getEval|LOG.info("this will NOT execute");
 label|HERE
 gotoIf|true|THERE
 getEval|LOG.info("this will NOT execute");
 label|THERE

 exitText
 getEval|LOG.info("this and any following commands will NOT execute");

Sample varset.xml:

 <testdata>
   <vars userid="dilbert" role="superuser" />
   <vars userid="wally"   role="lazyuser" />
 </testdata>

Sample varset.json:

 [
   { userid: "dilbert", role: "superuser" }
  ,{ userid: "wally",   role: "lazyuser" }
 ]

Note that if a data file is in the same directory as the invoking test script, then a relative file path can be used.

=try/catch/finally blocks=

Try can provide special handling when an error is thrown, and can guarantee execution of "cleanup" logic.

A <tt>catch</tt> block specifies what to do if an error is thrown in the try block. That is, if any statement within the <tt>try</tt> block, or in a function or sub-function called from within the try block, throws an error, then control jumps to the matching <tt>catch</tt> block and the error is cleared. If no error is thrown in the try block, then the catch is block skipped. Catch intercepts a given error by matching on its error message, which is specified as a <tt>"substring"</tt>, or as a <tt>/regular expression/</tt>. Providing no specification will catch all errors.

A <tt>finally</tt> block executes after the try and catch blocks. It always executes regardless of whether or not an error is thrown or caught. It executes even if the try or catch block concludes via "flow change" commands: <tt>continue</tt>, <tt>break</tt>, or <tt>return</tt> commands.

Try blocks can be nested. If an inner try does not catch an error, the enclosing try/catch is entered. The contents of all nested finally block(s) are guaranteed to execute, innermost to outermost - again, even if error(s) occur along the way.

Both <tt>catch</tt> and <tt>finally</tt> are optional, but if neither is provided then the try simply has no effect. An optional identifier may be specified on <tt>try</tt> and <tt>endTry</tt>, which will be validated for proper pairing.

=Example of try/catch/finally=

 try|outer
   try|inner
     throw|"blamo"
     getEval|alert("this alert will NOT get executed")
   finally
     getEval|alert("1st")
   endTry|inner
   catch|/blamo/
     getEval|alert("2nd")
 endTry|outer

=Automatic Variables=

SelBlocks provides automatic variables in three situations:

* Inside a <tt>foreach</tt> or <tt>endForeach</tt> loop, <tt>${_i}</tt> holds the zero-based index of the loop iteration.
* When a function terminates via the <tt>return</tt> command, <tt>${_result}</tt> holds the result value.
* When an error is caught by a <tt>catch</tt>, <tt>${_error}</tt> holds the caught error object.

These variables can of course be referenced by SelBlocks commands as <tt>_i</tt>, <tt>_result</tt> and <tt>_error</tt>.

=Javascript Extensions=

These can be used in SelBlock expressions:

 String.isOneOf : Example: if|employee.isOneOf("dilbert","wally","ratbert")
 String.mapTo : Example: if|employee.mapTo("peon", ["dilbert","wally"]) == "peon"

 $e(locator) : Example: $e("link=SelBlocks review")
 $x(xpath) : Example: $x("//input[@id=(//label[.='User ID']/@for)]")

=Dependencies=

NONE

''Note that the [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stored-variables-viewer-seleni/ Stored Variables Viewer] addon will display the values of SelBlocks parameters, because they are implemented as regular Selenium variables. The only thing special about SelBlocks parameters is that they are activated and deactivated as execution flows into and out of blocks, eg, <tt>for</tt>, <tt>endFor</tt>, <tt>function</tt>, <tt>endFunction</tt>, etc. So this can provide a convenient way to monitor the progress of an executing test script.''

=Limitations=

SelBlock is incompatible with flowControl (and derivatives), because they unilaterally modify <tt>selenium.reset()</tt>. Note however that SelBlocks provides equivalent commands, and is generally a plug-compatible replacement.

You cannot use Set Start Point to begin execution in the middle of an if, for, try, or function. This is because each kind of block maintains context during its execution which is initialized when that block is entered from the top. Jumping into the middle of a block would have undefined behavior.

=Philosophical Note=

I tend to agree, in principle, with Dan Fabulich's view on keeping HTML Selenese simple. But in practice I am able to maintain MUCH simpler scripts by using some if/else and looping. Note that there is no language translation for SelBlock commands, so they're commented-out in exported test scripts. Although hand-translation in the target language ought to be pretty straightforward. I would just say, use these constructs judiciously.
