=SelBlocks 2.1=

Installer: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide-sel-blocks/versions/

=Description=

Provides Selenium commands for javascript-like conditionals, looping, callable functions, error catching, and JSON/XML driven parameterization.

=Features=

* Provides the following control structures: <tt>if</tt>/<tt>elseIf</tt>/<tt>else</tt>, <tt>try</tt>/<tt>catch</tt>/<tt>finally</tt>/<tt>throw</tt>, <tt>for</tt>/<tt>foreach</tt>/<tt>while</tt>, <tt>continue</tt>/<tt>break</tt>, <tt>call</tt>/<tt>function</tt>/<tt>return</tt>, <tt>loadXmlVars</tt>/<tt>loadJsonVars</tt>, <tt>forXml</tt>/<tt>forJson</tt>, <tt>exitTest</tt>
* Function and loop parameters use regular Selenium variables that are local to the block, overriding variables of the same name, and that are restored when the block exits.
* Command parameters are javascript expressions that are evaluated with Selenium variables in scope, which can therefore be referenced by their simple names, e.g.: <tt>i+1</tt>
* Variables can be configured via external XML and/or JSON files.
* A function definition can appear anywhere, (they are skipped over in normal execution flow).
* Functions can be called recursively.

=Examples of Use=

Note that Selenium performs variable substitution before each command executes. When Selenium variables are used in SelBlocks parameters, which are JavaScript expressions, they are evaluated as literals. So for example, you would write: <tt>$(userid}</tt>. Or more simply: <tt>userid</tt>.

 foreach|userid|"dilbert","dogbert"
   getEval|LOG.info("${userid}");
   if|userid=="dilbert"
     getEval|LOG.info("${userid}, our hero");
   elseIf|userid=="ratbert"
     getEval|LOG.info("${userid}, the villain");
   else
     getEval|LOG.info("${userid}");
   endIf
 endForeach

 for|i=1; i <= 10; i++
   getEval|LOG.info("${i}");
 endFor

 loadVars|varset.xml
 loadVars|varset.xml|userid=="wally"
 getEval|LOG.info("${role}");

 forXml|varset.xml
   getEval|LOG.info("${userid}: ${role}");
 endForXml

 -- log odd numbers from 0 to 10
 for|i=0; i <= 100; i++
   break|i==10
   continue|i%2==0
   getEval|LOG.info("${i}");
 endFor

 -- extravagant example, but demonstrates possibilities
 call|factorial|n=7
 function|factorial
   if|n<=1
     return|1
   else
     call|factorial|n=n-1
     return|n*_result
   endIf
 endFunction
 getEval|LOG.info("${_result}");

 skipNext|1
 getEval|LOG.info("this will NOT execute");
 skipNext|0
 getEval|LOG.info("this WILL execute");
 goto|HERE
 getEval|LOG.info("this will NOT execute");
 label|HERE
 gotoIf|true|THERE
 getEval|LOG.info("this will NOT execute");
 label|THERE

 exitText
 getEval|LOG.info("this and any following commands will NOT execute");

Sample varset.xml:

 <testdata>
   <vars userid="dilbert" role="superuser" />
   <vars userid="wally"   role="lazyuser" />
 </testdata>

Sample varset.json:

 [
   { userid: "dilbert", role: "superuser" }
  ,{ userid: "wally",   role: "lazyuser" }
 ]

Note that if a data file is in the same directory as the invoking test script, then a relative file path can be used.

=try/catch/finally blocks=

Try can provide special handling when an error is thrown, and can guarantee execution of "cleanup" logic.

A <tt>catch</tt> block specifies what to do if an error is thrown in the try block. That is, if any statement within the <tt>try</tt> block, or in a function or sub-function called from within the try block, throws an error, then control jumps to the matching <tt>catch</tt> block and the error is cleared. If no error is thrown in the try block, then the catch is block skipped. Catch intercepts a given error by matching on its error message, which is specified as a <tt>"substring"</tt>, or as a <tt>/regular expression/</tt>. Providing no specification will catch all errors.

A <tt>finally</tt> block executes after the try and catch blocks. It always executes regardless of whether or not an error is thrown or caught. It executes even if the try or catch block concludes via "flow change" commands: <tt>continue</tt>, <tt>break</tt>, or <tt>return</tt> commands.

Try blocks can be nested. If an inner try does not catch an error, the enclosing try/catch is entered. The contents of all nested finally block(s) are guaranteed to execute, innermost to outermost - again, even if error(s) occur along the way.

Both <tt>catch</tt> and <tt>finally</tt> are optional, but if neither is provided then the try simply has no effect. An optional identifier may be specified on <tt>try</tt> and <tt>endTry</tt>, which will be validated for proper pairing.

=Example of try/catch/finally=

 try|outer
   try|inner
     throw|"blamo"
     getEval|alert("this alert will NOT get executed")
   finally
     getEval|alert("1st")
   endTry|inner
   catch|/blamo/
     getEval|alert("2nd")
 endTry|outer

=Automatic Variables=

SelBlocks provides automatic variables in three situations:

* Inside a <tt>foreach</tt> or <tt>endForeach</tt> loop, <tt>${_i}</tt> holds the zero-based index of the loop iteration.
* When a function terminates via the <tt>return</tt> command, <tt>${_result}</tt> holds the result value.
* When an error is caught by a <tt>catch</tt>, <tt>${_error}</tt> holds the caught error object.

These variables can of course be referenced by SelBlocks commands as <tt>_i</tt>, <tt>_result</tt> and <tt>_error</tt>.

=Javascript Extensions=

These can be used in SelBlocks expressions:

 String.isOneOf : Example: if|employee.isOneOf("dilbert","wally","ratbert")
 String.mapTo : Example: if|employee.mapTo("peon", ["dilbert","wally"]) == "peon"
 String.translate : Example: if|employee.translate("e", "3"]) == "p3on"

 $e(locator) : Example: $e("link=SelBlocks review")
 $x(xpath) : Example: $x("//input[@id=(//label[.='User ID']/@for)]")

=Dependencies=

NONE

''Note that the [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stored-variables-viewer-seleni/ Stored Variables Viewer] addon will display the values of SelBlocks parameters, because they are implemented as regular Selenium variables. The only thing special about SelBlocks parameters is that they are activated and deactivated as execution flows into and out of blocks, eg, <tt>for</tt>, <tt>endFor</tt>, <tt>function</tt>, <tt>endFunction</tt>, etc. So this can provide a convenient way to monitor the progress of an executing test script.''

=Selenium Server=

Selenese scripts that use SelBlocks commands can also be run in Selenium Server
via the <tt>-user-extensions</tt> and <tt>-htmlSuite</tt> options.
Get the current <tt>user-extensions.js</tt> here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/refactoror/SelBlocks/master/user-extensions.js

For more information on running Selenium Server,
see: http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/08_user_extensions.jsp#using-user-extensions-with-selenium-ide

Note that prior to version 2.1 SelBlocks has been a Firefox extension only,
whereas Selenium Server can target a wide range of browsers.
SelBlocks currently passes its full regression test suite when run against:
* <tt>firefox</tt> (31.4)
* <tt>googlechrome</tt> (40.0)
* <tt>opera</tt> (27.0)
Community help is welcome and encouraged in expanding this list.
There are currently known issues with:
* <tt>iexplorer</tt> (11.0): <tt>Object.defineProperties</tt> fails - test-startup hangs
* <tt>safari</tt> (5.1.7): <tt>htmlTestRunner</tt> is not defined - test-startup hangs

Running scripts in Selenium Server introduces the possibilty of browser compatibility issues,
especially when running IDE-produced scripts against non-Firefox browsers.
Potential pain points include differences in
JavaScript error messaging, (e.g., <tt>expectError</tt>),
and XPath capabilities, (<tt>$x()</tt> and <tt>$X()</tt>).

When reporting an issue, be sure to provide very specific browser/OS info,
as well as the faling test case, test html, and error log.
Better yet, if you can fix the problem, submit a github pull request
-- which is how server support came about in the first place.
A big thanks to Matthew Kastor for this contribution!

=Limitations=

SelBlocks is incompatible with flowControl (and derivatives), because they unilaterally modify <tt>selenium.reset()</tt>. Note however that SelBlocks provides equivalent commands, and is generally a plug-compatible replacement.

You cannot use Set Start Point in the IDE to begin execution in the middle of an if, for, try, or function.
This is because each kind of block maintains context during its execution
that is initialized when that block is entered from the top.
Jumping into the middle of a block has undefined behavior.

Local file access is not supported by Selenium Server.
This might be problematic for commands like loadJsonVars, loadXmlVars, forJson and forXml.
However, files can be accessed via http.

Never use the ...<tt>AndWait</tt> counterpart of a SelBlocks command, e.g., <tt>ifAndWait</tt>.
(''Selenium automatically registers one with every defined command, even though it does not always make sense.'')
If you use one of these, (usually via inadvertent auto-completion),
SelBlocks will throw an error when you try to start the script in the IDE.
This is a bit more difficult to diagnose in Selenium Server,
which cannot currently detect the situation,
and therefore simply hangs without an error when such a command executes.

=Philosophical Note=

I tend to agree, in principle, with Dan Fabulich's view on keeping HTML Selenese simple.
But in practice you're able to maintain MUCH simpler scripts by using some if/else and looping.
Note that there is no language translation for SelBlocks commands,
so they're commented-out in exported test scripts.
Although hand-translation in the target language ought to be pretty straightforward.
I would just say, use these constructs judiciously.
